# ICSME'2020 Evaluation

This folder contains all scripts used to run the research questions we present in our ICSME'2020 paper _Shake It! Detecting Flaky Tests Caused by Concurrency with Shaker_. Each research question is associated with a folder and the corresponding `README.md` file contains the instructions for execution.

The `icsme2020-eval.sh` executes these scripts with the same configurations we used in the paper. 

If you want to perform a quick execution, you might run `quick-eval.sh`, as we reduce to a minimum the number of reexecutions and tests that will run. Bear in mind that this will provide different results than the ICSME evaluation. 

You can also edit the `quick-eval.sh` to produce customized runs of the evaluation.
